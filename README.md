# What’s new in Swift 5.5?

This is an Xcode playground that demonstrates the new features introduced in Swift 5.5: 

 * Async await
 * Async sequences
 * Effectful read-only properties
 * Structured concurrency
 * `async let` bindings
 * Continuations for interfacing async tasks with synchronous code
 * Actors
 * Global actors
 * Sendable and @Sendable closures
 * `if` for postfix member expressions
 * Allow interchangeable use of `CGFloat` and `Double` types
 * Codable synthesis for enums with associated values
 * `lazy` now works in local contexts
 * Extend property wrappers to function and closure parameters
 * Extending static member lookup in generic contexts
